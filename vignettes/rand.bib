title = {The method of minimization for allocation to clinical trials. a review},
abstract = {Minimization is a largely nonrandom method of treatment allocation for clinical trials. We conducted a systematic literature search to determine its advantages and disadvantages compared with other allocation methods. Minimization was originally proposed by Taves and by Pocock and Simon. The latter paper introduces a family of allocation methods of which Taves' method is the simplest example. Minimization aims to ensure treatment arms are balanced with respect to predefined patient factors as well as for the number of patients in each group. Further extensions of the method have also been proposed by other authors. Simulation studies show that minimization provides better balanced treatment groups when compared with restricted or unrestricted randomization and that it can incorporate more prognostic factors than stratified randomization methods such as permuted blocks within strata. Some more computationally complex methods may give an even better performance. Concerns over the use of minimization have centered on the fact that treatment assignments may be predicted with certainty in some situations and on the implications for the analysis methods used. It has been suggested that adjustment should always be made for minimization factors when analyzing trials where minimization is the allocation method used. The use of minimization may sometimes result in added organizational complexity compared with other methods. Minimization has been recommended by many commentators for use in clinical trials. Despite this it is still rarely used in practice. From the evidence presented in this review, we believe minimization to be a highly effective allocation method and recommend its wider adoption in the conduct of randomized controlled trials.},

title = {Design and analysis of randomized clinical trials requiring prolonged observation of each patient. I. Introduction and design},
abstract = {The Medical Research Council has for some years encouraged collaborative clinical trials in leukaemia and other cancers, reporting the results in the medical literature. One unreported result which deserves such publication is the development of the expertise to design and analyse such trials. This report was prepared by a group of British and American statisticians, but it is intended for people without any statistical expertise. Part I, which appears in this issue, discusses the design of such trials; Part II, which will appear separately in the January 1977 issue of the Journal, gives full instructions for the statistical analysis of such trials by means of life tables and the logrank test, including a worked example, and discusses the interpretation of trial results, including brief reports of 2 particular trials. Both parts of this report are relevant to all clinical trials which study time to death, and wound be equally relevant to clinical trials which study time to other particular classes of untoward event: first stroke, perhaps, or first relapse, metastasis, disease recurrence, thrombosis, transplant rejection, or death from a particular cause. Part I, in this issue, collects together ideas that have mostly already appeared in the medical literature, but Part II, next month, is the first simple account yet published for non-statistical physicians of how to analyse efficiently data from clinical trials of survival duration. Such trials include the majority of all clinical trials of cancer therapy; in cancer trials,however, it may be preferable to use these statistical methods to study time to local recurrence of tumour, or to study time to detectable metastatic spread, in addition to studying total survival. Solid tumours can be staged at diagnosis; if this, or any other available information in some other disease is an important determinant of outcome, it can be used to make the overall logrank test for the whole heterogeneous trial population more sensitive, and more intuitively satisfactory, for it will then only be necessary to compare like with like, and not, by chance, Stage I with Stage III.},

title = {Sequential treatment assignment with balancing for prognostic factors in the controlled clinical trial},
abstract = {In controlled clinical trials there are usually several prognostic factors known or thought to influence the patient's ability to respond to treatment. Therefore, the method of sequential treatment assignment needs to be designed so that treatment balance is simultaneously achieved across all such patients factor. Traditional methods of restricted randomization such as "permuted blocks within strata" prove inadequate once the number of strata, or combinations of factor levels, approaches the sample size. A new general procedure for treatment assignment is described which concentrates on minimizing imbalance in the distributions of treatment numbers within the levels of each individual prognostic factor. The improved treatment balance obtained by this approach is explored using simulation for a simple model of a clinical trial. Further discussion centers on the selection, predictability and practicability of such a procedure.},

title = {A treatment allocation procedure for sequential clinical trials},
abstract = {A dynamic treatment allocation procedure is proposed for clinical trials which require balancing across several prognostic factors. The treatment allocation decision is based on the minimization of a function which is an easily evaluated approximation to the variance of the treatment effect in a linear model relating the outcome variable to the chosen prognostic factors and selected interactions. By use of simulations, the procedure is shown to be superior to ad hoc procedures proposed by Pocock and Simon (1975, Biometrics 31, 103-115), over a variety of reasonable experimental situations. It is shown that it is feasible to evaluate the procedure by hand calculations and that it is extremely easy if a small programmable calculator is available. Practical problems relating to implementation of the procedure are discussed with special reference to multi-institutional clinical trials.},
